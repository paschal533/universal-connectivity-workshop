# Lesson 1: Identity and Basic Host

Welcome to your first step into peer-to-peer networking with libp2p! In this lesson, you'll create your very first libp2p peer and understand the fundamental concept of peer identity.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand what a PeerId is and why it's important
- Create cryptographic keypairs for peer identification
- Initialize a basic libp2p Host
- Run your first libp2p application

## Background: Peer Identity in libp2p

In traditional client-server applications, servers have known addresses (like domain names), but clients are anonymous. In peer-to-peer networks, every participant is both a client and a server, so each peer needs a stable, verifiable identity.

libp2p uses **cryptographic keypairs** for peer identity:
- **Private Key**: Kept secret, used to sign messages and prove identity
- **Public Key**: Shared with others, used to verify signatures  
- **PeerId**: A hash of the public key, used as a short identifier

This design ensures that:
1. Peers can prove they control their identity (via signatures)
2. Others can verify that proof (via public key cryptography)
3. Identities are compact and easy to share (via PeerId hash)

## Your Task

Create a Python application that:
1. Generates an Ed25519 keypair for peer identity
2. Creates a basic libp2p Host
3. Prints the peer's ID when the application starts
4. Runs a simple event loop (even though it won't handle events yet)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Your Main Function

Create `app/main.py` with the basic structure:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Lesson 1: Identity and Basic Host
Creates a basic libp2p host with cryptographic identity.
"""
```

**What’s happening here?**

- The `#!/usr/bin/env python3` line is like a note to your computer saying, “Run this script with Python 3.” It’s a standard way to make the script executable on Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux or macOS).
- The docstring (`"""..."""`) is a quick summary of what the script does: it’s Lesson 1 in learning how to build a `libp2p` host (a node in a P2P network) and give it a unique identity using cryptography.

**Why?** The shebang ensures the script runs with the right Python version, and the docstring is like a label on a jar, telling you what’s inside.

### 2. Imports

```python
import trio
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
import hashlib
import base58
```

**What’s happening here?**
This is like grabbing the ingredients for your recipe. The script pulls in:
- `trio`: A library for handling asynchronous tasks, like juggling multiple phone calls without dropping any. It’s used here to manage the host’s lifecycle.
- `cryptography.hazmat.primitives`: Tools for secure cryptography:
  - `hashes`: For creating cryptographic hashes (though not directly used here, imported for completeness).
  - `ed25519`: A fast and secure algorithm for generating keypairs (private and public keys) to identify your node.
  - `serialization`: Helps convert keys into a format you can use (like raw bytes).
- `hashlib`: A Python library for hashing data, used here to create a unique ID from the public key.
- `base58`: A library for encoding data in a compact, human-readable format (like Bitcoin addresses), used to make the peer ID look nice.

**Why?** These libraries provide the tools to create a secure identity, manage async operations, and format the peer ID.

### 3. LibP2PHost Class

```python
class LibP2PHost:
    """Basic libp2p Host implementation"""
    
    def __init__(self, private_key, peer_id):
        self.private_key = private_key
        self.peer_id = peer_id
        self.is_running = False
    
    async def start(self):
        """Start the host"""
        self.is_running = True
        print(f"Host started with PeerId: {self.peer_id}")
    
    async def stop(self):
        """Stop the host"""
        self.is_running = False
        print("Host stopped")
    
    def get_peer_id(self):
        """Get the peer ID"""
        return self.peer_id
```

**What’s happening here?**

This is like building a little control center for your P2P node, called `LibP2PHost`. Here’s what it does:
- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: When you create a host, you give it a private key (your secret) and a peer ID (your public name). It also sets a flag (`is_running`) to `False`, meaning the host isn’t active yet.
- **Start (`start`)**: Flips the `is_running` flag to `True` and prints a message saying the host is up with its peer ID. It’s marked `async` because it might do network stuff later (though here it’s simple).
- **Stop (`stop`)**: Sets `is_running` to `False` and prints that the host is stopped. Also `async` for future-proofing.
- **Get Peer ID (`get_peer_id`)**: Just returns the peer ID so others can see who you are.

**Why?** This class is like the blueprint for your P2P node. It’s basic for now (just starting, stopping, and storing an ID), but it’s a foundation you can build on to add networking features.

### 4. Main Async Function

```python
async def main():
    print("Starting Universal Connectivity Application...")
    
    # Generate Ed25519 keypair for peer identity
    private_key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()
    public_key = private_key.public_key()
    
    # Extract public key bytes for PeerId generation
    public_key_bytes = public_key.public_bytes(
        encoding=serialization.Encoding.Raw,
        format=serialization.PublicFormat.Raw
    )
    
    # Create PeerId by hashing the public key
    peer_id_hash = hashlib.sha256(public_key_bytes).digest()
    peer_id = base58.b58encode(peer_id_hash).decode('ascii')
    
    print(f"Local peer id: {peer_id}")
    
    # Create and start the libp2p host
    host = LibP2PHost(private_key, peer_id)
    await host.start()
    
    # Keep the application running
    try:
        while host.is_running:
            await trio.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Shutting down...")
        await host.stop()
```

**What’s happening here?**

This is the heart of the program, where everything comes together. It’s marked `async` because it uses `trio` for asynchronous operations. Here’s the step-by-step:
1. **Print a startup message**: Just a friendly “Hey, we’re starting!”
2. **Generate a keypair**: Uses Ed25519 to create a private key (your secret) and a public key (what you share). Think of it like creating a lock and key: the private key is yours, and the public key is what others use to verify you.
3. **Get public key bytes**: Converts the public key into raw bytes (a format suitable for hashing).
4. **Create a peer ID**: Takes the public key bytes, hashes them with SHA-256 (a secure way to create a unique fingerprint), and encodes the result in Base58 (a compact, readable format). This becomes your node’s unique ID, like a username.
5. **Print the peer ID**: Shows you the ID so you know who you are in the network.
6. **Create and start the host**: Makes a new `LibP2PHost` with the private key and peer ID, then starts it (which just sets `is_running` to `True` and prints a message).
7. **Keep running**: Loops indefinitely, checking every second if the host is still running. If you hit `Ctrl+C`, it catches the `KeyboardInterrupt`, prints “Shutting down...”, and stops the host.

**Why?** This sets up your node’s identity and starts a basic host that just sits there (for now). It’s like registering for a social network and logging in, but not chatting yet.


### 5. Entry Point

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    trio.run(main)
```

**What’s happening here?**

This is the standard way to say, “If this script is run directly (not imported as a module), start the `main` function.” The `trio.run(main)` part tells `trio` to handle the asynchronous `main` function, kicking off the whole program.

**Why?** It’s the “on” switch for the app, ensuring everything starts properly.

### Big Picture

This script is like a “Hello, World!” for P2P networking with `libp2p`. It:
- Creates a unique identity for your node using Ed25519 cryptography (a private-public keypair).
- Turns the public key into a compact, unique peer ID using SHA-256 and Base58.
- Sets up a basic `LibP2PHost` that can start and stop, though it doesn’t do much networking yet (it’s Lesson 1, after all!).
- Uses `trio` to manage the async flow, keeping the app running until you stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

Think of it as setting up a profile for your computer in a decentralized network. It’s not connecting to other peers or sending messages yet, but it’s got the basics: a secure ID and a way to say “I’m here!” This is a starting point you could build on to add features like connecting to other nodes or sending data, as seen in the more complex code you shared earlier.

import base58

class LibP2PHost:
    """Basic libp2p Host implementation"""
    
    def __init__(self, private_key, peer_id):
        self.private_key = private_key

    )
    
    # Create PeerId by hashing the public key
    peer_id_hash = hashlib.sha256(public_key_bytes).digest()
    peer_id = base58.b58encode(peer_id_hash).decode('ascii')
    
    print(f"Local peer id: {peer_id}")
    
    # Create and start the libp2p host
    host = LibP2PHost(private_key, peer_id)
    await host.start()
    
    # Keep the application running
    try:
        while host.is_running:
            await trio.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Shutting down...")
        await host.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    trio.run(main)
```

## Testing Your Solution

Run your application with:
```bash
cd app
python main.py
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Starting Universal Connectivity Application...
Local peer id: 8QmatENdmjQQqwGqkAdTyKMjwTtJJdqCfZ6jAFkchTw9bKS4
Host started with PeerId: 8QmatENdmjQQqwGqkAdTyKMjwTtJJdqCfZ6jAFkchTw9bKS4
```

Press Ctrl+C to stop the application.

### 🔑 Understanding Cryptographic Keys

**Ed25519** is a modern elliptic curve signature scheme that provides:
- Fast key generation and signing
- Small key sizes (32 bytes for public keys)
- Strong security guarantees
- Deterministic signatures

The private key stays secret and is used to prove identity, while the public key can be shared freely.

### 🆔 PeerId Format

In real libp2p implementations, PeerIds follow the multihash format:
- They start with a prefix indicating the hash algorithm
- They encode the length of the hash
- They contain the actual hash of the public key

Our simplified version just uses SHA256 + Base58 encoding for readability.

### ⚡ Async/Await Pattern

Python's trio is perfect for network programming because:
- It handles many connections concurrently
- It's non-blocking (doesn't freeze your program)
- It integrates well with networking libraries

The `while host.is_running` loop keeps our program alive to handle future network events.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Import Error**: If you get import errors, make sure you've installed the dependencies:
```bash
pip install cryptography base58
```

**Key Generation Fails**: The cryptography library requires system-level crypto libraries. On some systems you might need:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install openssl libffi
```
